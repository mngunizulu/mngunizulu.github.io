<p>Hi, I’m a certified data analyst who is a naturally analytic person, inquisitive and has a passion for problem-solving. As an entrepreneur I had to develop the ability to understand customers’ needs and requirements, trying to understand what the customer values in a product or service, even when they were unable to articulate themselves. </p>

<p>As production manager, gained knowledge and understanding of process-flows, and in a previous role as Commercial Manager (‘Kaufmann’) at an e-commerce, business had the opportunity to work with data sets in Excel ranging between 16,000 and 32,000 rows, every month. Was able to help reduce packaging costs at this e-commerce firm by 80%, by suggesting changes in supplier and packaging materials.</p>

<p class="mb-5">. I was drawn to the conclusion that there has always been an interest in data and how the sourcing, processing and implementation of insights can lead to better decision making in all parts of a business. Transforming raw data into actionable insights is a passion.</p>
