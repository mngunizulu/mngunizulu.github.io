<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction & Objectives</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every year there is an influenza season, identified with a spike in the number of influenza infections and resulting hospitalisations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was asked to analyse historical data, to forecast staffing needs for a medical staffing agency, which provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis across the USA.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It began with drawing business requirements from stakeholder meetings, pointing to areas of concern and ideas for the analysis itself.</p>

<p><b>Tools:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Excel (Pivot, VLOOKUP, Integration)</li>
        <li>Tableau Public for visualizations</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><b>Data:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Open source data</li>
        <li>4 Possible Data sets</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 1: Data Selection</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After drawing of requirements from the stakeholders, it was time to evaluate each data set. I conidered the source of data, its reliability, ownership and ethical concerns (since I am using some medical data, this is important).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Because my focus was on sending the staff to those states which will experience the greatest need I focused not on reported influenza cases but on actual deaths related to influenza. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From 4 possible datasets I chose to use:
    <ol>
        <li>US Census Data by Geography</li>
        <li>US Influenza Deaths</li>
    </ol>
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Step 2: Cleaning & Consistency Checks</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I inspected the data in Excel. I discovered that there naming inconcistencies which I corrected and also regions (like in Puerto Rico) which are not within the US, which I eliminated from the data set.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Where there were missing values or names, I inserted averages, modal values. Now that the dat was cleaned and workeable  could proceed with the next step.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Step 3: Integration</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To be able to use a data set for analysis one must often integrate/ merge data using some common key or variable. This is because we seldom find a complete data set which is ready for use as is. This is what this step was about.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I began by mapping the data, trying to find commonalities between the two data sets. I identified 'state' and year as common columns. But the US Census data had records for each county in each state, whereas the Influenza Deaths data was only for each state. This was a 'granularity' issue.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I created a pivot table for the US Census data, which summed up the records for each state. Knowing that I would perform hypothesis testing, I preemptively grouped deaths and popuations into 65+ and < 65 years of age.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now the data was ready for integration. So I used a VLOOKUP to integrate the data sets into one.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 4: Statistical Analysis & Testing</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So now that I knew which were the top countries, and the respective top cities and customers in those countries, I wanted know which genres generated the highest revenue. Also of interest were the ratings which were most popular.</p>
