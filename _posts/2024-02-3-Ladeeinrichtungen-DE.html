<p style="text-align: justify;">Being something of an eco-warrior myself, I am interested in the development of electric vehicle industry to date as well as the possible future. So I decided to search for open-source data available on this topic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately for me, I was able to find some interesting data which was made available from the German government through "gov.de". The dataset came in the form of a csv file. This will be a brief look at the spacial analysis I did.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[This project is in Progress]</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Tools:
    <ul>
        <li>Excel</li>
        <li>VLOOKUP, IF and OR statements</li>
        <li>Tableau Public for visualizations</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Data:
    <ul>
        <li>>44,000 Rows & 18 variables</li>
        <li>Germany (all 16 Bundesl√§nder)</li>
        <li>open source data</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Step 1: Data Cleaning</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imported the file to Excel. I chose to use Excel at this point, because the dataset was not very large and I had no plans as yet to perform any major statistical analyses. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The data came with street names and house numbers, as well as Coordinate points for each charging station. Even the names of the operators were included. I decided to delete street names and addresses from the working data, because of privacy concerns. There were public as well as private operators named.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the data which I considered sensitive, I left the names of the operators, because with the help of a formula, I was able to extract whether the owner/operator of each charging station was a private person, business or public enterprise. More on this later!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I ended up deleting several columns which were not useful or had far too many missing values to be reliable (i.e. >10% missing values).</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 2: Data Wrangling</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the basic inspection and cleaning up of the dataset, I noticed that the zip codes (PLZ) were either broken or imported into Excel incorrectly. WIth the help of a concatenate funtion I remedied this problem.</p>
