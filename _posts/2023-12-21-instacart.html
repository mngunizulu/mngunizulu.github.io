<p>Instacart is a real online store which makes some of its data pubicly available. Customer data was synthesised for the purpose of this project. The objective of this project was to answer complex business questions for the marketing and sales teams at Instacart.</p>

<p>In search of answers to questions like:
    <ol>What are busiest days of the week?</ol>	
    <ol>What are the busiest hours of the day?</ol>    	
    <ol>Are there particular hours of the day where spending is the most?	</ol>
    <ol>What are the price range groupings like?</ol>	
    <ol>Are there certain types pf products are more popular than others?</ol>	
    <ol>Are there differences in ordering habits based on customer loyalty?</ol>  	
    <ol>Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?	</ol>  
    <ol>Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?</ol>  
</p>

<p>To answer these questions and gleam further insights into the sales and operations of Instacart, I used Python and a host of powerful libraries</p>

<p>Tools:
    <ol>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
        <li>Libraries : Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib,</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Data:
    <ol>
        <li>>3 Million Rows & 23 variables</li>
        <li>open source data</li>
        <li>Joins: Order, product, customer & Department </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Let's Begin!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Cleaning the Data</h2>

<p>The analysis began with consistency checks. Looking for missing values and duplicates in the data  was the first step. Also basic descriptive statistics were used to find out if there were any extreme values which may be erroneous.</p>

<p>I also confirmed that were mixed type values in some of the columns which required correction. Jupyter Notebook was used to compile the code into neat and manageable scripts. Use was made of libraries within Python, such as seaborn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
