<p>Instacart is a real online grocer that has made some of its data available for download and use. The customer dataset used as part of the analysis was synthesised and contains data on number of dependencies, income and more.</p>

<p>Several important business questions were answered to allow the hypothetical marketing department to better target its customer segments, as well as gleam insights into some of the operational aspects of the business. What follows is a presentation of the steps taken to uncover these findings, how this was done and the recommendations based thereon.</p>

<p>In search of answers to questions like:
    <ol>What are busiest days of the week?</ol>	
    <ol>What are the busiest hours of the day?</ol>    	
    <ol>Are there particular hours of the day where spending is the most?	</ol>
    <ol>What are the price range groupings like?</ol>	
    <ol>Are there certain types pf products are more popular than others?</ol>	
    <ol>Are there differences in ordering habits based on customer loyalty?</ol>  	
    <ol>Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?	</ol>  
    <ol>Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?</ol>  
</p>

<p>To answer these questions and gleam further insights into the sales patterns of Instacart, I used Python and a host of powerful libraries</p>

<p>Tools:
    <ol>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
        <li>Libraries : Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib,</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Data:
    <ol>
        <li>open source data</li>
        <li>>3 Million Rows</li>
        <li>23 numeric & categorical variables</li>
        <li>Joins: Order, product, customer & Department </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Let's Begin!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 1: Initial Exploration & Cleaning</h2>

<p>The first steps in this analysis involved inspecting the orders (transactions) and products data frames, to get an understanding of the shape of the imported data frames and the basic statistical descriptives.</p>

<p>Next were consistency checks. Here I wrote code to search for missing values and mixed value types in the columns. I investigated missing values by creating subsets for the missing values. Some rows were deleted. Where there were missing values for the “days since prior order column I established that these were new customers. I dealt with this in the next stage.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 2: Data Wrangling</h2>

<p>In this step I first identified columns which were unnecessary for the analysis and dropped them from the dataframe. I also renamed some columns for easier understanding and changed the 'order_id' column from integer to string type.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 3: Merging Data Sets</h2>

<p>Before merging the datasets to create a composite table, I confirmed the shapes of the data sets. This means looking at the number of rows and columns in each, so that I can choose the appropriate type of join.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
