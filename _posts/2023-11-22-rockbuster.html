<p style="text-align: justify;">Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental business which has failed to innovate and adapt with the times. They werere still renting videos online!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately for them, they realised thier error and decided to make a change to compete with streaming services. But before they launched, they wanted to use their historical data (in a relational database) to draw insights to develop a focused strategy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Rockbuster is a fictional business, created for my Career Foundry course, but the queries used are real, and the insights, well, insightful.</p>

<p>Tools:
    <ul>
        <li>Excel (queries to CSV for visuals in Tableau)</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL (Queries, Subqueries, CTEs, Joins)</li>
        <li>Tableau Public for visualizations</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Data:
    <ul>
        <li>Relational Database</li>
        <li>2 Fact tables & 13 Dimension tables</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Step 1: Getting to know the Data</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I began by creating a diagram of the datatables, which exhibited a snowflake pattern. I also created a data dictionary so that I would have a quick reference for the more complicated joins later on. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I examined the structure of the tables in the database as well as the type of data contained within them</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thereafter, I searched for any duplicate records or missing values in the customer and film tables, because these would have skewed the results. I confirmed that there were neither.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally I queried to obtain basic descriptive for the numerical columns in the film table. These include MInimum, Maximum and Averages for the respective columns.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 2: Defining Questions</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To give direction to the project, I began by defining questions which I would like to answer.</p>

<p>In search of answers to questions like:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>What are the average/ maximum movie rental rates?</li>	
    <li>What are the average movie rental durations?</li>    	
    <li>Which countries contribute most to revenue?	</li>
    <li>Which genres contribute the most to revenue?</li>	
    <li>Where do we find our most loyal customers by spend?</li>	 
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 3: Results</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For a closer look at some of the queries I used, you can download the project folder. The button for which is at the bottom of this case study. What follows is an overview of results.</p>
